			<!--Problem Domain-->
			<section>
				<p>
					In today's society, credit cards and <a
					href="https://merchants.fiserv.com/en-us/resources/what-are-mobile-payment-solutions/
					" target="_blank">mobile payments</a> have almost replaced cash as the mainstream payment methods.  The ever-increasing convenience of living has implicitly created challenges for people's savings awareness and asset management. Many individuals, especially for the younger generation, have trouble managing their money.  It is common to hear a peer complain how they are on a tight budget at the end of each month.

			<!--App Description-->
			<section>
				<p>
					For this Monkey Master that we proposed, we expect everybody can be a user of our web app, especially people who have income and a lot of spendings. This app will use the information given by the user. The user will input what they bought and how much it is into our app, and our app will store it and do some calculations based on it. We will also let users set their own category names, so that they can have the maximal flexibility. Basically we have proposed 4 different features for user's interaction: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						To begin with, the first feature is for the user to record each expense. They can choose or create their tag in order to categorize their each expanse. Monkey Master tracks their total expenses and what exactly they spent on.
					</li>
					<li>
						On top of categorizing the user's expense, we are planning on a filter feature that enables the users to filter the information they are concerned with. For example, the users can choose to view their expenses by month, but also by the category of food, games or vacations.
