				<p>
					In today's society, credit cards and <a
					href="https://merchants.fiserv.com/en-us/resources/what-are-mobile-payment-solutions/
					" target="_blank">mobile payments</a> have almost replaced cash as the mainstream payment methods.  The ever-increasing convenience of living has implicitly created challenges for people's savings awareness and asset management. Many individuals, especially for the younger generation, have trouble managing their money.  It is common to hear a peer complain how they are on a tight budget at the end of each month.

			<!--App Description-->
			<section>
				<p>
					For this Monkey Master that we proposed, we expect everybody can be a user of our web app, especially people who have income and a lot of spendings. This app will use the information given by the user. The user will input what they bought and how much it is into our app, and our app will store it and do some calculations based on it. We will also let users set their own category names, so that they can have the maximal flexibility. Basically we have proposed 4 different features for user's interaction:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						To begin with, the first feature is for the user to record each expense. They can choose or create their tag in order to categorize their each expanse. Monkey Master tracks their total expenses and what exactly they spent on.
					</li>
					<li>
						On top of categorizing the user's expense, we are planning on a filter feature that enables the users to filter the information they are concerned with. For example, the users can choose to view their expenses by month, but also by the category of food, games or vacations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Other than accessing our individually, Monkey Master can also be used by groups. The third feature is to automatically separate bills for groups of people. To be specific, it is common for different people to pay for different bills among a group of family or friends. It’s inconvenient to sum up and divide the money every time since the amount each person should pay for often varies. Thus, we enable the users to record the total of each expense, the person who paid for the bill, and number of people they wish to divide upon. As a result, it will provide the users with a conclusion of how much each person should pay for.
					</li>
					<li>
						Lastly is our reminder feature. It is common for an individual to have something they really want, but short in budget. Monkey Master aims to help the users to customize their budget. The app will automatically create a monthly plan on the money that should be saved after the user has typed in the money they need and the months he or she has to reach the “goal”. If the budget saved for this month is not enough or close to running out, the app will alert the user.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Overall, the features designed for our app can advance the users with better finance management and build stronger financial habits. Through Monkey Master, people can easily grasp the amount and proportion of their various expenditures. This will help them have a good understanding of their income and expenditure, which will be of great help in personal financial planning.
